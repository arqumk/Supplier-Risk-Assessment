# Supplier Risk Assessment using Machine Learning

---

## Project Overview

Managing suppliers at scale is never easy, especially when some quietly become liabilities. In this project, I worked with a global logistics client to build a system that could automatically assess and flag suppliers based on risk. 

We trained a classification model to categorise suppliers as **High Risk**, **Medium Risk**, or **Low Risk**, based on how they performed across communication, delivery, and operational behaviour. The idea was to give sourcing and procurement teams an early warning system, something data-backed that could complement their experience and instinct.

## What We Looked At

To make this work, we combined data from a few key systems:

-  **Communication logs** – e.g., how long it took suppliers to respond, how often conversations escalated  
-  **Orders and requisitions** – cancellation rates, delivery timelines, fulfilment success  
-  **Supplier master records** – profile information, past compliance flags, regional context  

We had to clean and unify these datasets before doing any modelling - a lot of value came from just surfacing inconsistencies.

## What We Wanted to Achieve

- Identify suppliers that could potentially become delivery risks  
- Give sourcing managers actionable insights to follow up on  
- Move beyond gut-feeling by showing clear, explainable risk scores  
- Help prioritise new onboarding reviews and contract renewals

## How We Approached It

We treated this as a supervised classification problem. Here’s the breakdown:

1. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Built features like `response_time_avg`, `order_delay_rate`, `escalation_ratio`, and `compliance_flag_count`  
   - Normalized supplier performance across regions and categories  

2. **Modeling & Evaluation**  
   - Tried several models (Random Forest, XGBoost) — XGBoost gave the best balance of precision and recall  
   - Used manually labeled data from past high-risk incidents as training targets  
   - Focused on interpretability using **SHAP** to explain why a supplier was tagged risky  

3. **Explainability First**  
   - Created per-supplier breakdowns showing which features contributed most to their risk label  
   - Shared results with stakeholders to validate that the model matched real-world intuition

## What It Delivered

-  Surfaced risky suppliers that weren’t on the team's radar  
-  Provided clear, interpretable reasons for each classification  
-  Saved time by automating what was previously a manual review  
-  Helped prioritize supplier audits and renewal decisions
